# ROS1 MkE Point Cloud Nodes #

The MkE SDK provides C++ and Python implementations of ROS1 point cloud publisher nodes.

## C++ Publisher Node

The C++ implementation of ROS1 publisher node is called `mkeros1_node`. This node is capable of connecting to a MagikEye sensor via the MkE API and publishing its 3D data via a ROS topic. Note that the code depends on the C++ MkE API client library [libmkeclient](../cpp/README.html) which is also distributed as a part of this SDK.

## Python Publisher Node

The Python implementation of ROS1 publisher node is called `pymkeros1_node`. This node is capable of connecting to a MagikEye sensor via the MkE API and publishing its 3D data via a ROS topic. Note that the code depends on the Python MkE API package [pymkeapi](../python/README.html) which is also distributed as a part of this SDK.
