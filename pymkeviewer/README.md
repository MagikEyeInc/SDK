# PyMkEViewer #

The PyMkEViewer is a python package that can be used to connect to and visualize point clouds coming from MagikEye sensors. The viewer is distributed in a form of a [Python wheel](pymkeviewer-1.2.3-py3-none-any.whl)  which can be easily installed--along with its dependencies--using the `pip3` tool:
```
$ pip3 install pymkeviewer-1.2.3-py3-none-any.whl
```

> **Note:** The `pymkeviewer` package depends on the `pymkeapi` 
> [package](../client/python/README.html) that needs
> to be installed prior to installing the `pymkeviewer` package itself.
