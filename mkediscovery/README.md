# MkEDiscovery #

When Ethernet and TCP connections are supported by a sensor, the sensor can also optionally implement SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) for advertisement and discovery. MkEDiscovery is a multi-platform GUI utility that lists names and IP adresseses of Magik Eye sensors supporting SSDP discovery on the local network. It is based on the [Qt toolkit](http://qt.io) and the [libmkeclient](../client/cpp/README.html) library.
